Here’s a step-by-step recipe for bringing your GEDI points into QGIS, extracting Sentinel-2 values at those locations, and then using both datasets together to look for linear depressions (trenches) in your anomalous zone:

---

## 1. Load your GEDI CSV as a point layer

1. **Layer → Add Layer → Add Delimited Text Layer…**

   * **File name:** your CSV
   * **Geometry definition:** “Point coordinates”
   * **X field:** your longitude column
   * **Y field:** your latitude column
   * **Geometry CRS:** EPSG:4326 (WGS 84)
2. Click **Add**. You should now see your GEDI shots as a point layer.

> **Tip:** If your CSV has header rows or weird delimiters, open it in a text editor first to verify the columns.

---

## 2. Reproject (if needed) to match your Sentinel-2 data

Most Sentinel-2 scenes come in UTM.

1. Right-click your GEDI point layer → **Export → Save Features As…**
2. Set **CRS** to match the Sentinel-2 mosaic (e.g. EPSG:32722 for UTM zone 22 S).
3. Save as a GeoPackage or Shapefile.

---

## 3. Bring in your Sentinel-2 imagery

1. **Layer → Add Raster Layer…** and select your composite (e.g. an RGB or SWIR band stack).
2. Make sure it’s in the same CRS as your reprojected GEDI points.

## 4. Sample Sentinel-2 values at GEDI locations

You have two main options:

### A. “Point sampling tool” plugin

1. **Plugins → Manage and Install Plugins…** → search “Point Sampling Tool” → Install.
2. **Plugins → Analyses → Point Sampling Tool**

   * **Layer containing sampling points:** your GEDI points
   * **Layers to sample:** check your Sentinel-2 raster(s)
   * **Output point vector layer:** choose a new GeoPackage or CSV
3. Run. The output layer now has Sentinel-2 band values in its attribute table.

### B. Built-in “Sample raster values”

1. **Processing → Toolbox → Raster analysis → Sample raster values**
2. **Input point layer:** your GEDI points
3. **Raster layers:** your Sentinel-2 bands
4. **Output:** new point layer with added fields

---

## 5. Compute canopy–ground height difference

1. In the new sampled point layer’s attribute table, open **Field Calculator**.
2. Create a new field, e.g. `dHeight`, with expression:

   ```
   "canopy_height" - "ground_height"
   ```
3. Click OK. Now each point has a `dHeight` value.

---

## 6. (Optional) Interpolate a continuous height-difference surface

To better visualize subtle linear lows:

1. **Processing → Toolbox → Interpolation → Inverse distance weighting (IDW)**
2. **Input point layer:** your sampled GEDI points
3. **Interpolation attribute:** `dHeight`
4. **Cell size:** match your Sentinel-2 resolution (e.g. 10 m)
5. **Output raster:** a new IDW surface

---

## 7. Derive slope or shaded‐relief from the interpolated surface

Trenches often appear as linear bands of higher slope:

1. **Raster → Analysis → Slope…**
2. **Input layer:** your IDW raster
3. **Output:** slope raster (degrees or percent)

---

## 8. Styling for trench detection

1. **Sentinel-2**

   * Display as RGB or your clay-iron ratio index to highlight soil exposures.
2. **Height-diff or slope raster**

   * Use a **single-band pseudocolor** ramp with a narrow stretch around zero, or
   * Classify into a few bins so linear depressions (negative `dHeight`) stand out.
3. **Overlay**

   * Lower the opacity of your height-diff/slope layer to let Sentinel imagery show through.
   * Zoom into your 1.7 km circle and look for N–S or E–W linear lows—those could be trenches.

---

## 9. Quick visual QC

* **Identify clusters** of negative `dHeight` points, then
* **Zoom to the same area** in Sentinel-2 and inspect textural or spectral anomalies along those lines.

If both the point‐based dHeight and the Sentinel bands coincide in showing a linear low or different soil signature, you’ve got a strong trench candidate.

---

### Recap

1. Import your GEDI CSV as points.
2. Reproject to match Sentinel-2.
3. Sample Sentinel-2 bands at the GEDI points.
4. Compute canopy–ground height differences.
5. Optionally interpolate to a raster and derive slope.
6. Style and overlay to visualize possible trenches.

With these layers side by side, you can confidently compare ground-truth height anomalies against the spectral patterns in Sentinel-2 and spot linear depressions that might be archaeological trenches.
